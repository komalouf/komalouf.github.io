# Kalin Malouf
##### Mechanical Engineering and Product Design

##### Massachusetts Institute of Technology, B.S Mechanical Engineering, Class of 2016

I’m interested in product design and engineering projects which improve people’s lives and focus on education, environmental responsibility, or emerging fabrication and modeling tools. I value innovations which expand the potential of what people can discover, imagine, and create. I’m looking for a collaborative community in product design or mechanical engineering which pursues high quality work rather than individual success.
